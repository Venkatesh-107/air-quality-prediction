## 🚀 Features

- Predicts Air Quality Index (AQI) using ML models
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Supports multiple regression models
- Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
- Modular and extensible structure

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3
- Weather: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed
- Timestamps and/or locations

Make sure the dataset is placed in the `data/` folder or update the path in the code.

````

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venkatesh-107/air-quality-prediction.git
cd air-quality-prediction
```

2. Prepare your dataset and update the path if needed.

3. Run the training and prediction:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. (Optional) Use notebooks to visualize or analyze results.

## 📈 Example Results

```
MAE: 12.34
RMSE: 18.56
R² Score: 0.87
```

(Replace with your actual model results.)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
* Use LSTM or time series models for multi-step forecasting
* Live AQI data integration (via APIs)
* Geo-visualization on maps
